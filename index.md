# Time and Location

Spring 2018

Monday/Wednesday 4:30PM - 5:50PM

Lecture Room: 110-101 in the Main Quad

# Overview

High-performance network system design. Students will work in teams of two to build  a fully functioning Internet router. Students will design the control plane in Python on a linux host and will design the data plane in the new P4 language on the NetFPGA 4 x 10GE switch. For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the other teams by building a small topology utilizing erveryone's router. In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router), Verilog experience for one member of each team is helpful but not required.

# Teams

The class will be broken down into teams of two students. One teammate will be responsible for the P4 data-plane implementation and the other teammate will be responsible for the Python control-plane. We leave it up to each team to decide how to they would like to divide up the workload amongst themselves. However, we highly encourge close collaboration and consulation so that each member is intimiately familiar with both aspects of the router implementation.

# Class Router Interoperation

Routers by nature work cooperatively in large complex environments. In fact, much of the complexity in router design and implementation is inter-operating with routers developed by different teams based on varying assumptions of standard protocol specifications. Inter-operation is such a critical feature of network infrastructure development that it is one of the major focuses of this course. For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate interoperability of thier router will all other teams' routers. The students are responsible for initiating communication between groups, coming up with a cooperative integration plan and ensuring that your routers not only inter-operate with our supplied reference solutions, but all other routers in the class. It is our goal that every finished router will be able to route traffic cooperatively on a large shared topology.

We have reserved a portion of the total class points to allocate based on participation during inter-operation. This means that we expect all the students to be pro-active from the start about planning and communicating a solid inter-operation strategy between teams during development. It is a good idea to collectively map out a strategy early on in the quarter and have incremental goals that can tested piece-wise. You may meet during designated course hours (since not all lectures are held), use the class Piazzza site for communication, email or meet during class hours.
