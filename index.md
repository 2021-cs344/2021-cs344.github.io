# Time and Location

Spring 2018
Monday/Wednesday 4:30PM - 5:50PM
Lecture Room: 110-101 in the Main Quad

# Overview

High-performance network system design. Students will work in teams of two to build 
a fully functioning Internet router. Students will design the control plane in C on 
a linux host and will design the data plane in the new P4 language on the NetFPGA 
4 x 10GE switch. For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers 
can interoperate with the other teams by building a small scale datacenter topology. 
In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design 
challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at 
Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router), Verilog experience for one member of 
each team is helpful but not required.
