We have provided you with some starter code in a P4->NetFPGA project directory called `simple_router`. The directory structure is as follows:

```
simple_router
|- Makefile
|- src: P4 source files and static table entries used for data-plane simulation
|- sw: Control-plane source files, control-plane simulation files, P4->NetFPGA generated API and CLI files
|- testdata: source files for data-plane simulations
|- simple_sume_switch
   |- test: Full NetFPGA simulation files
   |- hw: Top level HDL source files
   |- sw: Software to read all SUME control regs
   |- bitfiles: directory to store bitfiles
```
