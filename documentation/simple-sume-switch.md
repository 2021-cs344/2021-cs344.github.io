title: SimpleSumeSwitch Architecture
---

We will be using the latest version of SimpleSumeSwitch architecture, which has not been fully merged into the upstream P4-NetFPGA-live repository. As such, the documentation of the SimpleSumeSwitch architecture on the P4-NetFPGA-public wiki is slightly out of date. Refer to this document instead for details about the operation of the SimpleSumeSwitch.
