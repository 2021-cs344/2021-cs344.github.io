title: Design Challenge Project Proposal
---

The design challenge is your opportunity to do something novel and interesting. You may propose to do a project of your own choosing, but we do encourage you to consider pursuing one of the potential projects listed below. We would like to avoid having too many groups working on the same project so the proposal will help us to gauge interest in the various topics. The proposal should be a 1-page document that includes the information listed below:

* Project title
* Problem Statement and Motivation
* Initial thoughts for system design / verification

# Potential Projects


# Submission

Each team should email your proposal to the instructors using the subject line: CS344 Project Proposal - Team-X
