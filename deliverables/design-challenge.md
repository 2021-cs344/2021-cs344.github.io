title: Design Challenge Project Proposal
---

The design challenge is your opportunity to do something novel and interesting. 

You may propose to do a project of your own choosing, but we do encourage you to consider pursuing one of the potential projects listed below.

We would like to avoid having too many groups working on the same project so the proposal will help us to gauge interest in the various topics.

The proposal should be a 1-page document that includes the information listed below:

* Project title
* Motivation - why is this project interesting?
* Initial thoughts for system design / verification

# Potential Projects

#### Scheduling Algorithms in P4

The packet processing capabilities of the P4 language are second to none. That being said, there has been very little discussion around ways to program the traffic management capabilities of network devices. Modern programmable switches offer a small menu of common scheduling algorithms, but provide no mechanism for allowing network operators to define their own algorithms. The [PIFO (Push-In-First-Out) queue](http://web.mit.edu/pifo/pifo-sigcomm.pdf) was recently proposed as a convenient abstraction that can be used to implement many different scheduling algorithms, and hence provides a mechanism to make packet scheduling programmable. PIFOs differ from traditional scheduling mechanisms because they decide the packetâ€™s scheduling order at the time of enqueue rather than as the packet leaves the queue. The PIFO queue consists of two components: a programmable rank computation and a fixed scheduler. The rank computation can be expressed in P4 and it produces the packet's rank, which is an indication of its priority. The scheduler then schedules the packet relative to the packets that are sitting in the queue according to it's assigned priority. By using the appropriate rank computation, we can implement many different scheduling algorithms such as:

* Priority queues
* Round robin
* Weighted round robin
* Minimum rate guarantees
* Start time fair queueing
* Deficit round robin
* Least slack time first
* Stop-and-Go Queueing

In this project, you will explore how to practically implement the rank computation for various scheduling algorithms in P4.

# The Prize

We will invite some members from the networking community to the final presentations & demonstration day. These invited guests will serve as judges along with the instructors to decide upon the best group project. The winning group will have the opportunity to present their demo at the [P4 Workshop in Cambridge, UK](https://p4.org/events/2018-09-24-p4-eu-workshop/). 


# Submission
